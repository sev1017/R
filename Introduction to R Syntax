Data Types
 
Numeric: Any number with or without a decimal point: 23, 0.03and the numeric null value NA.

Character: Any grouping of characters on your keyboard (letters, numbers, spaces, symbols, etc.) or text. 
Most strings are surrounded by single quotes: ' ... ' or double quotes " ... ", though we prefer single quotes. 
Sometimes you will hear this type referred to as “string.”

Logical: This data type only has two possible values— either TRUE or FALSE (without quotes). 
It’s helpful to think of logical types or booleans as on and off switches or as the answers to a “yes” or “no” question.

Vectors: A list of related data that is all the same type.
NA: This data type represents the absence of a value, and  
is represented by the keyword NA (without quotes) but it has its own significance in the context of the different types.
That is there is a numeric NA, a character NA, and a logical NA.
